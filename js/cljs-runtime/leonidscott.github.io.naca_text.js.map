Nevertheless, the infinite varieties of possible shapes a foil can take can be daunting, hard to communicate, and obscure the geometric properties that contribute to performance.

Today, we know of NACA as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NACA developed the NACA-4 series of foils in the process of building an extensive public catalog of foil shapes that engineers could pick from in order to achieve their design targets. NACA 4 foils are composed of three numbers, expressed as four digits (lol don't tell me this is a government project), that each encode a geometric property of a foil shape.\"]])\n\n(defn geometric-properties []\n  [:<>\n   [:h2 \"Geometric Properties\"]\n\n   [:p \"The following pictures shows the slightly arched, teardrop foil shape we often think of when we think of an aerofoil:\"]\n\n   [img-comp {:src  \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Chord_length_definition_%28en%29.svg/2880px-Chord_length_definition_%28en%29.svg.png\"\n              :alt  \"cord-line-image\"\n              :href \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28aeronautics%29\"}]\n\n   [:p \"Running directly from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the foil is the \" [:em \"cord line\"] \".

Deviating from the camber line, and giving the foil its arched shape, is the \" [:em \"camber line\"] \". Notice that the upper and lower surfaces of the foil are always the same distance perpendicular to the camber line. Finally, the teardrop shape of the foil is created by varying the thickness of the foil along the camber line, rapidly increasing until a maximum thickness (about 1/4 way down the foil), and slowly tapering off to the trailing edge.\"]])\n\n(defn naca-mpxx []\n  [:<>\n   [:h2 \"NACA MPXX\"]\n\n   [:p \"NACA 4 foils use the following format for encoding these features: \" [:code \"NACA MPXX\"] \".\"]\n\n   [:img {:src \"imgs/NACA4-Desc.PNG\"\n          :alt \"NACA4-Desc\"\n          :style {:width \"-webkit-fill-available\"\n                  :padding \"20px 15%\"}}]\n\n   [:li [:b \"M (Maximum Camber) \"] \"determines the maximum deflection the camber line makes from the chord line. \" [:em \"M \"] \"is defined as a percentage of the chord line length, as a hundredth of a percentage point.

By default, NACA 4 foils are closed at their trailing edge, meaning the upper and lower surfaces of the foil blend into a single sharp edge. By contrast, in an open trailing edge foil, the upper and lower surfaces form to create a blunt trailing edge. Open trailing edge foils tend to create slightly more lift and drag than their closed counterparts. In addition, they tend to produce less trailing edge vibrations that can result in audible noise, this is especially true for rudders on ships.
