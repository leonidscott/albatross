     "We define a foil by its purpose, not it's geometry. Nevertheless, the infinitie varieties of possible shapes a foil can take can be danting, hard to communicate, and obscure the geometric properties that contribute to performance. The NACA series encodings directly address these problems by creating a simple, standardizable  way to represent a foil shape, and in doing so, communicate the geometric properties of a foil that fundementally impact its ability to produce lift and drag."]]])
